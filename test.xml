When the function actually is called, the stack  is restored, and additional parameters which are the inline function  parameters, are passed.  </remarks>  </library> <p/> <library  name="y_thirdpartyinclude"  version="0.2"  license="(c) 2022 YSI contibutors, licensed under MPL 1.1"  summary="Include a load of other libraries that YSI depends on, looking in about 27 different likely  locations."  >  <summary pawndoc="true">  This library uses the enhanced <em>pawndoc.xsl</em> from  <a href="https://github.com/pawn-lang/pawndoc">pawn-lang/pawndoc</a>.

The change was to match people's misunderstanding of the syntax,  rather than the correct interpretation of what enums are.  This is an enum  with a multi-cell increment within it used to detect which enum sizeof  method is in use.  </remarks>

The macro also looks for a semi-colon  to match; however, if semi-colons are optional an end of line will also  match a semi-colon in a macro.  We then use this name in a test that does  NOT end with a semi-colon.  If <c>-;-</c> is active the macro will take  precedence and produce <c>0</c>.  If <c>-;+</c> is active the macro will  not match, and so the variable will be used instead.  Thus in this way we  can detect the flag.  </remarks>

You can use <c>#emit CONST.pri 0xFFFFFFFF</c>, i.e.  encode <c>-1</c> as a twos-complement hex value (why do hex numbers work  when negative numbers don't), but this is not very readable, and can't be  improved with <c>#define</c> as macros don't work with <c>#emit</c> either  (again, why does <c>const</c> work when <c>#define</c>, and even <c>#if</c>  doesn't).

			<hidden />  <remarks>  This variable only exists to hide other variables.  It end a massive  comment block in the pawndoc XML output that hides all internal  variables - that is, those that start with <c>_</c>.  This is a very  common pattern used throughout YSI (and most of programming).  Unfortunately these weirdly named internal variables appear in the  generated documentation always.  This is the best way to hide them.  You  still see some internal variables (<c>_0</c> - <c>_9</c>), but those  have a legitimate reason to be documented externally.  <p/>  This is <c>_zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy</c> and ends the internal  variables block.  This is the last possible name before the first  character is no longer <c>_</c>, except for one, when the functions are  sorted lexicographically (alphabetically).  There's also  <c>_zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</c> that ends the functions block;  they could have the same name if they were not declared in the same  scope, but they might not always be separately defined.  <p/>  Note that the actual hiding itself is done by an XML comment started  earlier and ended here.  </remarks>  -->

The <c>_A</c> macro can be used to convert four  characters in to the special format used by <c>pattern</c> (which is really  just the C string as a 32-bit number).  <p/>  <em>y_hooks</em> uses this function to find all of its special hook  functions, which start with the magic four character sequence  <c>"@yH_"</c> (both a prefix for this function, and a public function  declaration as it starts with <c>@</c>), like so:  <p/>  <code>  new idx = 0, buffer;                                                      <br />  while ((idx = AMX_GetPublicEntryPrefix(idx, buffer, _A&lt;@yH_&gt;)))     <br />  {                                                                         <br />  }  </code>  <p/>  The <em>entry</em> is a pointer in to the table itself, i.e. address/name  pair relative to <c>DAT</c>.  You should not use this function directly,  but one of the macro wrappers defined for sorted tables:  <p/>  <c>AMX_GetPublicEntryPrefix</c>  <c>AMX_GetPubVarEntryPrefix</c>  <c>AMX_GetLibraryEntryPrefix</c>  <c>AMX_GetTagEntryPrefix</c>  <p/>  <p/>  Prefixes are widely used in YSI as the names are sorted and so can be  binary searched, the entries point to the start of the names, and once a  prefix is passed there can be no more later (thanks to sorting).  Thus  binary prefix searches are extremely efficient.  </remarks>

This doesn't matter as it would be done regardless of  hash method, so this doesn't need to be accounted for.  Speed is all that  matters with at least least a bit of non collision (the number of strings  we're dealing with, this should have none-to-few collisions).  <p/>  I modified it slightly from the original code pasted by aru, to code closer  to <a href="http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html">the code</a>  and to work with PAWN (and shaved 0.2us off the time for one call :D).  <p/>  Uber reduced version (just for fun):  <code>  b(s[]){new h=-1,i,j;while((j=s[i++]))h=h*33+j;return h;}  </code>  <p/>  Update: Contrary to what I said above this is also used to identify colour  strings for the updated text system involving file based styling and this  is not checked for collisions as it's unimportant.  But this doesn't affect  the function at all, I just mentioned it here for "interest".  </remarks>

Useful  for seeing if two strings are similar to humans.  This is nothing like the  more common <em>Levenshtein Distance</em>, which pretty much compares  strings at an ASCII character level, so two very different strings can be  apparently more similar than two others.  A good example of this, which was the motivation for writing this function,  was in <em>sscanf</em>.  When checking to see what vehicle a player wrote,  the input <c>NRG</c> would return <c>TUG</c> as the closest match.  Why?  Because they're both three letters and share the last <c>G</c>, so  mechanically they are only two transformations apart; whereas <c>NRG-400</c>  needs four transforms to get to from the input.  So this code looks at how  much of each string is in the other string.  Very little of <c>TUG</c> is in  <c>NRG</c> and vice-versa, while all of <c>NRG</c> is in <c>NRG-400</c> and  a lot of the reverse is true.  This entirely ignores case, spaces, and punctuation in the comparisons.  </remarks>

			<remarks>  Looks up the callback by name.  If the name has the correct data embedded  within it that's great and we use that directly.  Otherwise this function  loops backwards over the callbacks currently in scope (mostly) to the start  of the parent function.  If a match is still not found this looks for a  public function of the same name.  If that isn't found either it gives up.  The new "remote" parameter returns instantly with a remote public function  stub, and no stored data.  </remarks>

			  <remarks>  Makes variables referenced, instead of valued.  When used after  "Callback_Call" the values of any variables in the enclosing function that  were modified in the inline function will be propgated so that their new  values are seen by the original parent function (rather than that function  still seeing the original values prior to the inline function modifying  them).  Note that this does no checks at all at the minute - if you call an  inline function whose parent is not currently on the stack, this will  probably fail catastrophically!  </remarks>

			<library>y_debug</library>  <remarks>  Does some strange mangling of <c>YSI_FILTERSCRIPT</c> because at one point  I found a compiler bug where the first automata in the script could  conflict with the first variable in the script.  I don't know what  triggered it, and it has never shown up since I messed about with this file  to try mangle some things.  Never the less, if it ever happens again this  code might detect it.  Actually, that's less likely now, since that  variable is now very unlikely to be the first in the script ever.  </remarks>

			<library>y_dumpamx</library>    <remarks>  Dump the currently running AMX to a file.  Although the AMX has surely just  been loaded <em>from</em> a file, this isn't pointless as a lot of code can  be (and is, with YSI) modified on initial load.  Thus this feature can do  the generation once, and store the result in to a new file that can be  loaded repeatedly.  Of course this is still pointless if your code changes  frequently, as the saving is quite slow and would need to be done after  every compile.  If a script is only likely to be loaded once after a  compile, with subsequent loads being for a new version, these is no  advantage to using this caching.  </remarks>

			<remarks>  Creates fake functions that Pawndoc comments can be attached to in the first  compilation phase, before the real macros are created.  Macros can't have  documentation comments, but why not?  They need documenting...  <p/>  Used internally as <c>YSI_FUNC_PAWNDOC</c>.  <p/>  This creates a native of the same name, then calls it from a special function  (called <c>PAWNDOC</c>) with a state set to the name of this function, to  avoid declaring multiple functions in the XML while ensuring that this fake  function is in the XML.  Natives aren't in the output unless they are called,  but we don't have to call them correctly because the container function is  never called.  You do need a fallback version of `PAWNDOC` to catch all other  state variations declared elsewhere in your script.  <p/>  <code>  #if defined MACRO_NAME                                                   <br /><indent />  // `#define MACRO_NAME` exists previously, don't document it here.   <br /><indent />  _FIXES_HIDE_PAWNDOC(SIMILAR_NAME);                                   <br />  #else                                                                    <br /><indent />  // Doesn't exist.

Used internally as <c>YSI_HIDE_PAWNDOC</c>.  <p/>  The input should have some unique name, so when using it within an ifdef  block, don't use the same name as the tested symbol, because the the  replacement in question will be applied to the hidden variable as well.  <p/>  This should also be a globally unique symbol name, because this only works  with `<c>const</c>`, not `<c>static const</c>`.  </remarks>

This means we already know of one hook, but to simplify  the code we get that one again here.  Above we only know the name not the  address.  Hence the "- 1" in "i = idx - 1" (to go back one function name).  Our "namelen" variable already contains the full length of the first found  hook - this is the length of "name", plus N extra characters.  The  following are all valid, and may occur when orders are played with:  @yH_OnX@  @yH_OnX@1  @yH_OnX@01  @yH_OnX@024  @yH_OnX@ZZZ  @yH_OnX@999@024  If we want to get the EXACT space taken up by all these hook names we would  need to get the string of the name in this function then measure it.  There  is really no point in doing this - if we have a second we will always have  enough space for our new names.  Instead, we assume that they are all just  @yH_OnX@  And add on that minimum length accordingly (plus 1 for the NULL character).  This length is used if the original callback doesn't exist but hooks do.  In that case we need to add the callback to the AMX header, and there is a  tiny chance that the original name will be longer than one hook's name.  In  that case, having two or more hooks will (AFAIK) always ensure that we have  enough space to write the longer name.  If there is only one hook, no original function, and the name of the hook  is shorter than the name of the original function then we have an issue and  will have to do something else instead.  </remarks>

			      <remarks>  Generates the code which copies the parameters from <c>Callback_Call</c> in  to the local stack.  All those parameters are passed by reference, since  the function is a varargs function.  Since an inline function's "input"  parameters are just regular variables on the stack, they all need  resolving, which is what this code does.  Regular variables are  dereferenced, and arryas and strings are fully copied over.  Technically this doesn't ACTUALLY do the copy, but generates the code for  the copy.  </remarks>

			      <remarks>  When the inline function ends, any parameters that were defined as being  passed by reference are copied back.  This is because true locals are never  by reference, so we fake it.  There is one bug with this method - aliased  variables won't work correctly:  <c>  inline Func(&amp;a, &amp;b)  {  ++a;   printf("%d", b);   }  new a = 10;  Callback_Call(using inline Func, a, a);  </c>  That will print <c>10</c> while the same code with a normal function will  print <c>11</c> thanks to <c>a</c> and <c>b</c> being aliased.  Maybe I  should add a <c>restrict</c> keyword, but even then I don't know how to  solve unrestricted variables (at best I can warn for them).  And this is  not a totally unheard of situation.  I have at least seen this for getting  only a player's height:  <c>  new z;  GetPlayerPos(playerid, z, z, z);  </c>  </remarks>

This allows you to chain calls to get multiple random values so follows:  new president     = Iter_Random(Player);  new vicePresident = Iter_Random(Player, president);  new primeMinister = Iter_Random(Player, president, vicePresident);  new minister      = Iter_Random(Player, president, vicePresident, primeMinister);  None of those values can be the same, and this saves horrible random-  dependent loops.  </remarks>

			<library>y_iterate</library>          <remarks>  Returns a random value from an iterator.  If additional parameters are given they are excluded from consideration.  This allows you to chain calls to get multiple random values so follows:  new president     = Iter_Random(Player);  new vicePresident = Iter_Random(Player, president);  new primeMinister = Iter_Random(Player, president, vicePresident);  new minister      = Iter_Random(Player, president, vicePresident, primeMinister);  None of those values can be the same, and this saves horrible random-  dependent loops.  </remarks>

			<library>y_iterate</library>  <remarks>  <p>Because of the strange way we manipulate the stack, this function actually  gets called twice as often as you would expect.  Essentially, for this  (psudo-)loop:</p>  <code>  for (new i = iter_func(); Iter_YieldLoop(); )                              <br />  {                                                                          <br />  }  </code>  <p>The loop is entered and <c>iter_func()</c> is called.  This indirectly  calls <c>yield</c>, which returns to the call point of that function.  The  loop check is then entered and <c>Iter_YieldLoop()</c> is called.  Depending  on if <c>yield</c> was actually used, the main loop body is entered.  At the  end of that iteration, the loop check is run again and so  <c>Iter_YieldLoop()</c> is called again.</p>  <p>This is where it gets wierd!</p>  <p><c>Iter_YieldLoop()</c> does a stack copy and a jump in to the earlier  call to <c>iter_func</c>, whose return address is earlier in the code.  When  a <c>yield</c> is done again, that return is to the first part of the  <c>for</c> loop, which then instantly enters the loop check section and calls  <c>Iter_YieldLoop()</c> again (as a side-effect, saving the iterator value in  the loop variable).</p>  <p>So for <c>N</c> iterations of the loop, <c>Iter_YieldLoop()</c> is called  <c>2N + 1</c> times, and should be made aware of which phase of its calls it  is in.</p>  <p>This is, of course, made more complicated by nested loops, but that just  means we need to store the state on our own stack.</p>  </remarks>

"rawmemset" is similar, but takes an AMX data segment address instead and  the size is in bytes, not cells.  However, the size must still be a  multiple of 4.  </remarks>

"MemSet" takes an array, the size of the array, and a value to fill it with  and sets the whole array to that value.  "RawMemSet" is similar, but takes an AMX data segment address instead and  the size is in bytes, not cells.  However, the size must still be a multiple  of 4.  </remarks>

			<library>y_scriptinit</library>      <remarks>  Write a disassembled version of the current state of the script to a file.  This is by far the most powerful debugging technique I've ever had while  developing YSI.  It is generally called twice - once before  <c>OnCodeInit</c> is run, and once after.  That callback does all of the  assembly-level transformations used to implement many of the advanced YSI  features.  Thus the two resulting dump files can be used to examine and  compare the results of every code rewrite done, and see where things have  gone wrong.  Plus, if anyone has a complex bug I can ask for those two files  and get a very complete view of what their script is trying to do, without  needing any of their source.  </remarks>

Actually, that's less likely now, since that  variable is now very unlikely to be the first in the script ever.  </remarks>

Note that I found  the most bizzare bug ever (I *think* it may be a compiler but, but it  requires further investigation), basically it seems that multiple variables  were being treated as the same variable (namely @YSII_EgotS and  @YSII_CgharacterS were the same and @YSII_EgotC and @YSII_CgharacterC were the  same).  Adding print statements which reference these variables seem to fix  the problem, and I've tried to make sure that the values will never actually  get printed.  </remarks>

			<hidden />  <remarks>  This function only exists to hide other functions.  It starts a massive  comment block in the pawndoc XML output that hides all internal  functions - that is, those that start with <c>_</c>.  This is a very  common pattern used throughout YSI (and most of programming).  Unfortunately these weirdly named internal functions appear in the  generated documentation always.  This is the best way to hide them.  You  still see one function (this one), but at least the documentation for  this one function can explain why it exists.  <p/>  This is <c>Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</c> and starts the internal  functions block.  This is the last possible name before the first  character is <c>_</c> when the functions are sorted lexicographically  (alphabetically).  There's also <c>Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy</c>  that starts the variables block; they could have the same name if they  were not declared in the same scope, but they might not always be  separately defined.  <p/>  Note that the actual hiding itself is done by an XML comment started  here and ended later.  </remarks>  <!--

This should obviously not  be done without extreme care.  The general rule is only use this if the  change is promptly undone, so the changes are not externally visible from a  function.  For example when adding a null terminator to a constant string  to display it, then restoring it before ending:  <code>  PrintSome(const string[], n)                 <br />  {                                            <br /><indent />  new ch = _YSI_ConstMod(string[n], '\0'); <br /><indent />  print(string);                           <br /><indent />  _YSI_ConstMod(string[n], ch);            <br />  }  </code>  That will add a null terminator, use the shorter string, then (most  importantly) restore the old value of the string before the function ends.  From the perspective of anyone calling this example function the string is  the same after the call as it was before the call, hence the guarantees  offered by <c>const</c> are maintained, even if there's some internal  trickery going on.  <p />  It is also used to set <c>final</c> values, which aren't restored to their  old value, they are set once and never changed again.  </remarks>

			<hidden />  <remarks>  This function only exists to hide other functions.  It end a massive  comment block in the pawndoc XML output that hides all internal  functions - that is, those that start with <c>_</c>.  This is a very  common pattern used throughout YSI (and most of programming).  Unfortunately these weirdly named internal functions appear in the  generated documentation always.  This is the best way to hide them.  You  still see one function (<c>Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</c>), but at  least the documentation for that can explain why it exists.  <p/>  This is <c>_zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</c> and ends the internal  functions block.  This is the last possible name before the first  character is no longer <c>_</c> when the functions are sorted  lexicographically (alphabetically).  There's also  <c>_zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy</c> that ends the variables block;  they could have the same name if they were not declared in the same  scope, but they might not always be separately defined.  <p/>  Note that the actual hiding itself is done by an XML comment started  earlier and ended here.  </remarks>  -->

This doesn't matter as it would be done regardless of  hash method, so this doesn't need to be accounted for.  Speed is all that  matters with at least least a bit of non collision (the number of strings  we're dealing with, this should have none-to-few collisions).  <p/>  I modified it slightly from the original code pasted by aru, to code closer  to <a href="http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html">the code</a>  and to work with PAWN (and shaved 0.2us off the time for one call :D).  <p/>  Uber reduced version (just for fun):  <code>  b(s[]){new h=-1,i,j;while((j=s[i++]))h=h*33+j;return h;}  </code>  <p/>  Update: Contrary to what I said above this is also used to identify colour  strings for the updated text system involving file based styling and this  is not checked for collisions as it's unimportant.  But this doesn't affect  the function at all, I just mentioned it here for "interest".  </remarks>

"MemSet" takes an array, the size of the array, and a value to fill it with  and sets the whole array to that value.  "rawmemset" is similar, but takes an AMX data segment address instead and  the size is in bytes, not cells.  However, the size must still be a  multiple of 4.  </remarks>

"RawMemSet" is similar, but takes an AMX data segment address instead and  the size is in bytes, not cells.  However, the size must still be a multiple  of 4.  </remarks>

			<library>y_rconfix</library>  <remarks>  This code is always needed, even if fixes.inc exists, because y_master can  repeatedly load and unload it to use as a buffer filterscript.  Basically,  because this FS is always loaded it ensures that 16 other filterscripts  can't all be loaded at once.  So if 15 are loaded and we need an extra  space to reload one while preserving data we can unload this one, use the  spare space, then load this one back up again.  </remarks>
